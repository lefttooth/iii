lead researcher of the Environmental Impact Evaluation Framework (EIEF) for High-Performance Computing (HPC), I directed a comprehensive study designed to quantify and mitigate the environmental footprint of large-scale computing systems. This project arose from the growing global concern about the rapid expansion of HPC infrastructure and its soaring energy demands, which are projected to constitute a substantiTo achieve this goal, I conceptualized and developed three interconnected mathematical models, each addressing a distinct aspect of HPC’s environmental impact. The first, the Environmental Impact Evaluation Model (EIEM), quantified the direct carbon emissions generated by HPC energy consumption. I began by compiling large-scale datasets from the TOP500 HPC list, global energy statistics, and regional electricity carbon intensities. Through regression and sensitivity analyses, the model projected potential effects of HPC emissions on temperature rise, sea level increase, and ocean acidification under different growth and energy scenarios. The results revealed a concerning trend: if current energy consumption patterns persist, HPC could contribute nearly 20 percent of the world’s total environmental burden by 2030. This model provided the foundation for the entire framework and highlighted the urgency of the issue.The second model, the Carbon Intensity Approximation Model (CIAM), examined the potential of renewable energy integration to mitigate emissions. By simulating various levels of renewable adoption within global data centers, CIAM quantified the reduction in carbon output under different grid configurations. I designed this model to capture the complex relationships between renewable energy input, carbon efficiency, and operational performance. Our analysis showed that even a 30 percent increase in renewable energy usage could reduce overall HPC emissions by nearly half, emphasizing the crucial role of sustainable energy transitions in the future of computing technology.The third model, the E-Waste Assessment Model (EWAM), focused on the long-term ecological consequences of HPC hardware disposal. Using the entropy-weight method, I evaluated the relative toxicity of heavy metals and rare earth elements in HPC components and their combined impact on soil, air, and water systems. The model compared several disposal scenarios, ranging from unregulated dumping to closed-loop recycling, to estimate environmental and health risks. The findings indicated that improper disposal of e-waste could cause severe heavy metal contamination, while improved recycling systems could reduce environmental toxicity by more than 60 percent.Beyond model development, I consolidated our findings into a policy brief for the United Nations Advisory Board, advocating for the inclusion of a specific sustainability target for HPC within the UN 2030 Development Goals. I wrote the section recommending strategies to reduce non-renewable energy dependency, implement carbon-aware scheduling in HPC facilities, and improve global standards for e-waste management and recycling. The brief combined rigorous modeling results with policy-oriented proposals, demonstrating how quantitative analysis can inform effective environmental governance.Leading this research strengthened my ability to connect scientific precision with practical application. It required balancing analytical rigor with real-world feasibility and coordinating a multidisciplinary team that included experts in data science, environmental studies, and engineering.

photovoltaic (PV) energy potential across Africa over the past four decades. The study was motivated by a striking contradiction: although Africa receives the most sunlight in the world, it accounts for less than two percent of global installed solar capacity. I wanted to understand how changing climatic conditions might influence the continent’s true potential for solar energy generation. Using high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data from 1980 to 2020, I analyzed three key climate variables: solar radiation, air temperature, and wind speed. I constructed a multivariate decomposition framework to determine how each factor contributed to variations in PV potential and applied stability analysis through the coefficient of variation to assess annual reliability. This approach allowed me to evaluate both long-term trends and regional differences in solar energy potential. The results revealed that Africa’s overall PV potential increased by about 3.2 percent due to rising solar radiation, although higher air temperatures slightly reduced conversion efficiency. East Africa showed the greatest improvement, with over six percent growth and high stability, making it the most favorable region for large-scale solar development. North Africa’s potential declined slightly because of temperature-induced efficiency losses, while southern regions displayed greater variability caused by heatwaves and dust events. This research emphasized that the key to sustainable solar expansion in Africa lies not only in resource abundance but also in long-term stability and resilience. The project strengthened my skills in data modeling, statistical analysis, and climate interpretation, and reinforced my commitment to applying research for sustainable and equitable energy development.',\r\n    methodology: 'Multivariate decomposition framework using ERA5 reanalysis data (1980-2020), stability analysis through coefficient of variation, regional trend assessment',\r\n    technologies: ['Climate Data Analysis', 'Statistical Modeling', 'ERA5 Reanalysis', 'Geospatial Analysis'],\r\n    duration: 'Hours/Week:6 Weeks/Year:30',\r\n    featured: true\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    id: 'sawh-middle-east',\r\n    name: 'Quantifying the Irrigation Support Potential of Solar Atmospheric Water Harvesting in Arid Regions - A Case Study in the Middle East',\r\n    shortName: 'SAWH Irrigation Support',\r\n    category: 'Water Resources',\r\n    year: '2023',\r\n    images: [\r\n      require('@/assets/research/Quantifying the Irrigation Support Potential of Solar Atmospheric Water Harvesting in Arid Regions-  A Case Study in the Middle East/wKj0iWGoltiAFbipAAnTg8VWDp0823.webp')\r\n    ],\r\n    description: 'I investigated the potential of solar-powered atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) as a sustainable irrigation solution in the Middle East, a region where agriculture faces severe water scarcity and relies heavily on groundwater. The project aimed to determine whether SAWH could supplement irrigation and reduce water stress for key crops such as rice, wheat, and date palm. Using climate data from ERA5-Land (1980–2020), I calculated crop water demand through reference evapotranspiration (ET₀) and standard crop coefficients (Kc). I then developed a ratio model (R) to compare water yield from SAWH with irrigation requirements, enabling spatial and seasonal assessment across multiple countries. The analysis revealed significant regional variation. In some areas, atmospheric water could exceed local irrigation needs (R up to 50:1), while in highly arid regions, annual ET₀ (~2200 mm) far surpassed rainfall, showing that conventional irrigation remains essential. Crops like rice and date palm had the highest water requirements, around 1500–1800 mm and 1400–1600 mm per year, respectively. For example, irrigating one hectare of date palms (~15,000 m³/year) would require roughly 7.7 hectares of SAWH collectors at a daily yield of 0.5 L/m². This study highlights SAWH’s potential as a supplementary water source, particularly during dry seasons, and underscores the role of technology in supporting climate-resilient agriculture and sustainable water management in arid regions.',\r\n    methodology: 'Ratio model (R) comparing SAWH water yield with crop irrigation requirements, spatial and seasonal assessment using ERA5-Land data,
